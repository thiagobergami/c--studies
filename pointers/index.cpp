/* 

Pointer giver power to alocating and dealocating memory 

Pointer is a variable whose values is an address

to declare:
variable_type *pointer_name;

int *int_prt {}; // a pointer to a integer

initializing pointer variables to point nowhere

    - Always initialize pointers
    - Uninitialized pointers contain garbage data and can 'point anywhereÂ´
    - initializing to zero or nullprt(C++ 11) represents address zero
        - implies that the pointer is 'pointing nowhere'
